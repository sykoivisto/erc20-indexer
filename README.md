# Simple ERC-20 Indexer
![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

WIP indexer- adding features as I go.

Features implemented:  
- Fetching the balances using alchemy api
- Clean UI using React, bootstrap and chakra
- Form validation checks for valid address using ethers library
- Toast message if form isn't valid or if there is another error with the alchemy api call

Planned features:
- Connect web3 wallet to check balances without typing address
- Beautify the ui with better cards (its clean rn but a little ugly imo)
- Light/dark mode switch
